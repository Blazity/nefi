title: Command parameters
---

**nefi** has a few command parameters that can be passed to the command line to the executable.

## Flags list

<Callout type="info">
All flags are optional and can be used in any combination.
</Callout>

1. `--verbose` - enables verbose logging. Useful for debugging and troubleshooting.
   Please refer to the [reporting an issue](/docs/usage/reporting-an-issue) guide for more information.

2. `--usage` - prints the usage of the Anthropic API in tokens

3. `--force-write` - forces **nefi** to write the changes to the repository. 
                     By default **nefi** will work only if the working tree is clean (all changes are either stashed or committed)

###  Example

Example command with all the flags:

```bash
npx nefi --verbose --usage --force-write
```
