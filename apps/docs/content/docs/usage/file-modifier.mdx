### File Modifier

Configuration of the project as a whole usually mean not only [installing the packages] but also modifying the files such as Next.js config or adding new sample components and routes. **nefi** can help you with that too

### Augmentations

1. [x] Modifying the existing files with preserving current content / code style 
2. [x] Adding new files to the project basing on the user's request

### Quality of Life features

1. The file modifications happens granularly. This means that **nefi** updates file one after one and not all at once. This is done in order to reduce token usage regarding calling the LLM and for easier control of the potential rate-limiting.
