### Git Operations

At the end of the [execution pipeline] **nefi** will usually suggest to create a new branch with the changes it has made along with commiting it. This is done to keep the previous branch clean and to allow for easy rollback of the changes.

### Augmentations

1. [x] Creating a new branch with the changes
2. [x] Committing the changes
3. [x] Following the conventional commit branch name and message format

### Quality of Life features

1. [x] Detecting the `gpgsign` flag in the git config. Currently **nefi** will not sign the commit and skip the feature of commiting the changes but the new branch will still be created.
