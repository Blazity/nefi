# Introduction

nefi /ˈnɛfi/ is an AI-powered agent that automates code management and feature integration in Next.js codebases through natural language commands, handling everything from git operations to package management and file modification. This tool streamlines the process of adding new features while maintaining high code quality standards.

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';
 
<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why is it called nefi?">
    **nefi** stands for **n**ext-**e**nterprise **f**eature **i**ntegrations   
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Motivation

The whole idea behind this tool is to reduce the amount of manual work and time spent on common tasks like setting up the **next-enterprise** boilerplate for your personal needs. It is common that not every application requires e.g. storybook integration (althought we love it!). nefi allows you to just type remove storybook from my project and it will be done.

The best way to start interacting with **nefi** is to use it along with the **next-enterprise** boilerplate as it contains
solid, minimalistic and robust project structure out of the box

### Tutorial

Follow the instructions and paste following commands in your terminal:

<Steps>
 <Step>
   #### Clone the boilerplate

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blazity/next-enterprise.git && cd next-enterprise
```

 </Step>
 <Step>
  #### Run agent

<Tabs items={["npx", "yarn", "pnpm dlx", "bunx"]}>
  ```ts tab 
  npx nefi
   ```

  ```ts tab yarn
  yarn nefi
  ```

  ```ts tab pnpm dlx
  pnpm dlx nefi
  ```

  ```ts tab bunx
  bunx nefi
  ```
</Tabs>

 </Step>
</Steps>

and thats it! 

## API Keys 

**nefi** relies heavily on the Anthropic's API.

Every time the agent is launched it will search for the key in the following places

1. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your shell environment variables
2. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your `.env` file in a directory where you've launched `nefi`
3. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` file in a directory where you've launched `nefi`

If the key is not found, the agent will prompt you to enter it and will create a `.env.local` file _(or append the key to the existing one)_ in the directory where you've launched `nefi`.


### How to obtain the API key

<Steps>
 <Step>
   #### Set up an Anthropic account 

   Please visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and set up an account.

 </Step>
 <Step>
   #### Create a new API key
   Click on the "Create API key" button and give it a name.
 </Step>
 <Step>
   #### Copy the API key
   Copy the API key and paste it into running `nefi`, your shell environment variables or `.env` file.
