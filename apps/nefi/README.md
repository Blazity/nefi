**nefi /ˈnɛfi/** is an AI-powered assistant that automates code management and feature integration in Next.js codebases _(primarily [next-enterprise] repository)_ through natural language commands, handling everything from git operations to package management and file modification. This tool streamlines the process of adding new features while maintaining high code quality standards.

 The whole idea behind this tool is to reduce the amount of manual work and time spent on common tasks like setting up the [next-enterprise] boilerplate for your personal needs. It is common that not every application requires e.g. storybook integration (althought we love it!). **nefi** allows you to just type `remove storybook from my project` and it will be done.
